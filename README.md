Since the site is ran locally, you will need to run `node index.js` to start it.

My web application includes several features to enhance the user experience and provide them with a comprehensive platform to track their personal fitness and nutrition goals. These features are:

    About Us page: Users can access an About Us page that provides information about the application and its purpose.

    User registration: Individuals can easily register for the application by providing their personal details.

    User login: Registered users can log in to their account with their username and password.

    Nutrition and Fitness Information: Users can access information about nutrition, fitness,  and maintaining a healthy lifestyle to gain a better understanding of how to reach their goals.

    Personal Goal Setting: Users can define personal goals in nutrition, fitness, and healthy lifestyle categories.

    Goal Management: Users can add, remove, and modify their personal goals for several weeks ahead to help them stay on track.

    Goal Tracking: Users can tick off their goals once completed to keep track.

    Personal Achievement History: Users can review their history of personal achievements to see how far they have come and track their progress over time.


specific's:
    Users can mark as `completed` but also mark as `uncompleted`.
    Once the goal is marked as completed it will increases the `reps` (times achieved) by 1.
    Users can set the `start_date` for any time date, past, now or future, so if a goal was not tracked in the past they can still mark it,
    along with setting goals for weeks ahead, as required by the brief.
